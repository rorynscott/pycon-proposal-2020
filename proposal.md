# Proposal

## Title
- Self-Service Infrastructure with Luigi, AIOHTTP, and Jira Service Desk
- Automating Jira Tickets with Luigi and AIOHTTP

## Duration
I prefer a 30 minute slot

## Description

Being a Jira Ticket Monkey is no fun, but being a roadblock might be even less fun. By leveraging Spotify's Luigi Workflow Engine and SOA/AIOHTTP, we can create a self-service interface through which repetitive tickets are resolved quickly in a standardized way.

## Who and Why (Audience)

- Platform Engineers
- Site Reliability Engineers
- DevOps-minded teams and individuals
- Infrastructure Teams

## Outline

## Additional Notes

## Personal Notes/Thoughts/Streams
- Platform team is relatively small; 1-4 engineers
- Supports development teams, which has outpaced platform growth due to acquisitions
- Historically, new tasks coming in were handled manually or moderately manually; i.e. terraform modules, bash scripts, cloud formation
- Migrating from AWS to GCP
- Amount of toil is too high, interfering with migration and team development work
- Team is also becoming a bottleneck, preventing teams from moving forward quickly; compliance + manual work + prioritization
- Python, along with SOA and workflow orchestration, to the rescue!
